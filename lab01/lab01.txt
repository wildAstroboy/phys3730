I have basic experience of C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript that I have been practicing for that past 2  years. I mostly work on Mac OSX Systems but am also comfortable with using any flavor of Linux.

I have not taken 2235.

Brushed up on my python skills and well as thought of a new LED art installation I want to build.
